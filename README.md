# dotfiles
My own dotfiles. Might look silly to you, look reasonable to me. I probably won't accept PR's or any other form of patches, unless it either achieves the same outcome with less complexity or is just straight out a better option. I don't want to clogg my homedir with settings I won't ever use.

You can as always still clone this repo and make your own modificaitions. I tried to allow easy modifications throught *_local files, but that might not always be possible. 

Things you should know if you want to use them directly:

- I use ZSH, so some things might not work out-of-the-box for you.
- I didn't include the dependencies in this repository. Those would be:
	- Antigen
	- FZF
	- eye3d (For autotagger)
	- livestreamer (for twitch command and some aliases)
	- catimg (for viewimage)
